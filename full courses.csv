"Churchill's ""Darkest Hour""","The 2017 film and companion volume, ""Darkest Hour"" recounts how Winston Churchill, upon becoming Prime Minister of the U.K. in the first year of World War II, gave three historic speeches to galvanize the will of his Cabinet colleagues, parliamentarians and the nation as a whole to fight on against Nazi Germany in the face of impossible odds. This blog highlights those speeches and a follow-up blog will canvass Churchill's rhetorical devices.",Blogs

Canada Revenue Agency and the Respectful Workplace Campaign,"This is a case study of how one organization worked to create a respectful workplace environment as a means of retaining and developing its staff. The IT Branch was faced with competition for valued IT staff and recognizing that it wanted a positive culture in which to generate ideas and services for its agency. The IT Branch decided to engage staff in ways to make the workplace more positive and inviting. It engaged in both a top-down, research and strategy driven effort combined with an all- hands engagement process to come up with a series of ways to create a respectful workplace. These efforts were supported over time and produced measureable results in terms of staff attitude and in retention success. This is a good case for those interested in producing work- floor level cultural change as well as in improving the ways staff interact in all directions in a truly respectful and productive fashion.",Case Studies
"Immigration, Refugees, Citizenship Canada � A Biometrics Screening Story","In the last decade, the Government decided to implement biometric screening on a larger scale. Explore the policy development process which made this priority a reality through a case study on the Temporary Resident Biometrics Project.",Case Studies
Passport Canada: Organizational Transformation in the Face of Policy and Demand Shifts,"When the United States imposed passport requirements on Canadians landing by air, a crisis was sparked at Passport Canada that exposed certain cultural and managerial weaknesses that had been developing over time. The response to the first wave of this change and preparation for the second wave enabled the leadership of Passport Canada to address the immediate situation with a series of measures designed to address the cultural fault lines as well as to just get through the day in crisis mode. The course of the response, still under way several years after the initiating event, represented a major transformation for this organization. Much can be learned from this transformation about the relationship between operating culture and outcomes, the need for internal cohesion in basic values, the role played by analytical information and not just data and the need for senior managerial focus on core cultural values in the resolution of an immediate threat. Finally, this is a very interesting case of how organizations learn from their challenges, their initial response and corrective measures.",Case Studies

Appreciative Inquiry,"Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a change management approach that focuses on identifying what is working well, analyzing why it is working well and then doing more of it. The basic tenet of AI is that an organization will grow in whichever direction that people in the organization focus their attention. If all the attention is focused on problems, then identifying problems and dealing with them is what the organization will do best. If all the attention is focused on strengths, however, then identifying strengths and building on those strengths is what the organization will do best.",Job Aids
