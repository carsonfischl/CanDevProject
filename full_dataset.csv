can have a significant impact on an individual's well-being.\n\nThis course will explore the signs, symptoms, and solutions for mental illnesses commonly experienced in the workplace.\n\nUpon completion of the course you will be able to:\n\nRecognize the signs of common mental illnesses at work\n\nReview practical situations and case studies including depression, phobias, anxiety

Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) 2015 (S115),"The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, or WHMIS, is a comprehensive system for providing health and safety information on the safe use of hazardous products in Canadian workplaces. In 2015, the Government of Canada amended the Hazardous Products Regulations and the Hazardous Products Act to align WHMIS with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). WHMIS 2015 sets forth the roles and responsibilities of suppliers, employers, and workers.

Difficult People: Why They Act That Way and How to Deal with Them (W018),"Any human behaviour taken to an extreme can be a liability.

While occasional griping is endurable, constant negativity can wear you down. \nAll sorts of situational and personal circumstances can make a somewhat difficult person into an extremely difficult person in no time.

Negotiation Essentials: What Is Negotiation? (X038),"Everyone has to negotiate at some point in life. Strong negotiating skills can be survival skills, both in and out of the workplace. But being able to negotiate successfully requires that you understand some of the basic concepts of negotiation. Negotiation has been described in many ways: getting what you want, reaching an agreement, influencing others, and bargaining, to name a few. However you think of it, though, negotiation is a process in which two or more parties with different needs and goals work together to find a solution that is acceptable to all.\n\nThis course defines negotiation and describes actions that can help you negotiate successfully. It also discusses two types of negotiation�distributive and integrative�that you will typically encounter in business.

Optimizing Your Work/Life Balance: Taking Control of Your Stress (X040),"Are you constantly adding items to your to-do list? Does it seem like your list never shrinks? Are you feeling overwhelmed at work and at home? Are you afraid that stress is starting to negatively impact your health and relationships? Stress is produced by your own feelings and reactions to certain external events, rather than by the events themselves. And while you may not always be able to control the external events that are causing you stress, you can control your reactions to them and how you handle them. \n\nThis course will explain how the signs and symptoms of stress can be physiological, behavioural, or psychological in nature and where these stresses can come from.

Planning Meetings Fit for Purpose (C061),"Have you ever sat through a meeting that you felt was a waste of your time? Maybe the meeting wasn't relevant to you or it was just poorly run. Perhaps it lacked a clear purpose. The root cause of ineffective meetings is almost always poor planning. Meetings are among the most expensive forms of communication in today's business environment, so it's essential to make the investment worthwhile. This course outlines a process for preparing for effective meetings. First, you'll learn how to clarify the purpose and objectives of a meeting. Second, you'll learn how to determine if the meeting is required or if a meeting alternative can fulfill the objectives. Third, you'll learn how to choose the best participants.

Verifying and Building on Creative Ideas (D020),"The initial stages of idea generation require an open approach uninhibited by rationale and critique. But sometimes you first need to check if the ideas are grounded in reality and feasible from an organizational viewpoint.

Canada Revenue Agency and the Respectful Workplace Campaign,"This is a case study of how one organization worked to create a respectful workplace environment as a means of retaining and developing its staff. The IT Branch was faced with competition for valued IT staff and recognizing that it wanted a positive culture in which to generate ideas and services for its agency. The IT Branch decided to engage staff in ways to make the workplace more positive and inviting. It engaged in both a top-down, research and strategy driven effort combined with an all- hands engagement process to come up with a series of ways to create a respectful workplace. These efforts were supported over time and produced measureable results in terms of staff attitude and in retention success.

Passport Canada: Organizational Transformation in the Face of Policy and Demand Shifts,"When the United States imposed passport requirements on Canadians landing by air, a crisis was sparked at Passport Canada that exposed certain cultural and managerial weaknesses that had been developing over time. The response to the first wave of this change and preparation for the second wave enabled the leadership of Passport Canada to address the immediate situation with a series of measures designed to address the cultural fault lines as well as to just get through the day in crisis mode. The course of the response, still under way several years after the initiating event, represented a major transformation for this organization. Much can be learned from this transformation about the relationship between operating culture and outcomes, the need for internal cohesion in basic values, the role played by analytical information and not just data and the need for senior managerial focus on core cultural values in the resolution of an immediate threat. Finally, this is a very interesting case of how organizations learn from their challenges, their initial response and corrective measures.",Case Studies,"{""challenges"":1,""their"":2,""learn"":1,""organizations"":1,""how"":1,""case"":1,""corrective"":1,""interesting"":1,""initial"":1,""very"":1,""finally"":1,""threat"":1,""situation"":1,""leadership"":1,""well"":1,""enabled"":1,""core"":1,""preparation"":1,""second"":1,""wave"":2,""can"":1,""with"":1,""role"":1,""passport"":3,""this"":4,""united"":1,""first"":1,""time"":1,""been"":1,""that"":2,""weaknesses"":1,""managerial"":2,""landing"":1,""canadians"":1,""and"":6,""certain"":1,""much"":1,""over"":1,""developing"":1,""on"":2,""of"":6,""the"":16,""requirements"":1,""states"":1,""for"":4,""address"":2,""imposed"":1,""crisis"":2,""from"":2,""when"":1,""data"":1,""resolution"":1,""by"":2,""exposed"":1,""just"":2,""air"":1,""in"":3,""to"":4,""as"":2,""be"":1,""outcomes"":1,""response"":3,""had"":1,""a"":4,""sparked"":1,""values"":2,""is"":1,""at"":1,""series"":1,""an"":1,""cultural"":3,""measures"":2,""several"":1,""about"":1,""fault"":1,""internal"":1,""information"":1,""relationship"":1,""lines"":1,""get"":1,""designed"":1,""learned"":1,""through"":1,""day"":1,""mode"":1,""course"":1,""still"":1,""under"":1,""cohesion"":1,""way"":1,""immediate"":2,""years"":1,""canada"":2,""after"":1,""represented"":1,""initiating"":1,""event"":1,""change"":1,""major"":1,""need"":2,""transformation"":2,""organization"":1,""between"":1,""operating"":1,""culture"":1,""basic"":1,""played"":1,""was"":1,""analytical"":1,""not"":1,""senior"":1,""focus"":1}","{""shifts"":1,""organizational"":1,""and"":1,""in"":1,""canada"":1,""the"":1,""demand"":1,""passport"":1,""transformation"":1,""face"":1,""of"":1,""policy"":1}","{""challenges,"":5.43372,""their"":3.86234,""learn"":1.93721,""organizations"":3.82428,""case"":4.33511,""corrective"":6.35001,""interesting"":5.65687,""initial"":5.43372,""very"":5.43372,""values"":4.15279,""focus"":4.09872,""situation"":4.74057,""leadership"":3.60917,""well"":3.32959,""enabled"":6.35001,""core"":4.47821,""preparation"":5.94455,""wave"":14.0863,""can"":2.12318,""with"":1.38717,""role"":3.21452,""passport"":21.1295,""this"":3.40319,""united"":5.94455,""been"":4.04743,""that"":3.43057,""weaknesses"":6.35001,""managerial"":11.8891,""be"":2.11591,""landing"":7.04316,""canadians"":4.84594,""and"":3.89741,""threat."":6.35001,""certain"":5.09725,""much"":5.09725,""over"":4.74057,""developing"":3.74732,""on"":3.3826,""finally,"":4.20995,""requirements"":3.82428,""the"":11.0206,""of"":4.79396,""air,"":7.04316,""time."":4.84594,""states"":5.94455,""for"":5.20063,""address"":8.54114,""imposed"":7.04316,""crisis"":14.0863,""from"":5.73755,""measures."":7.04316,""when"":2.83847,""data"":4.47821,""resolution"":5.2514,""by"":4.59646,""values,"":5.65687,""exposed"":5.94455,""just"":9.29053,""to"":2.76212,""as"":3.99947,""response"":9.48115,""had"":5.94455,""a"":4.32862,""sparked"":7.04316,""is"":1.47101,""at"":2.54335,""series"":3.54665,""an"":1.68657,""cultural"":14.2217,""measures"":5.43372,""several"":5.94455,""about"":2.43799,""fault"":7.04316,""internal"":4.27057,""information"":2.90003,""relationship"":4.74057,""lines"":7.04316,""get"":3.95212,""designed"":3.28196,""learned"":5.94455,""through"":2.88428,""day"":5.43372,""in"":2.64586,""how"":1.41195,""mode."":7.04316,""first"":3.71096,""response,"":5.94455,""event,"":6.35001,""course"":1.42276,""still"":5.09725,""under"":4.4041,""cohesion"":7.04316,""way"":3.78506,""immediate"":11.3137,""years"":5.2514,""canada"":5.70701,""after"":4.55825,""represented"":7.04316,""initiating"":6.35001,""change"":3.21452,""major"":5.2514,""need"":6.30268,""transformation"":9.48115,""second"":3.99864,""organization."":3.82428,""was"":3.74732,""analytical"":5.94455,""not"":3.35428,""between"":3.60917,""operating"":5.43372,""culture"":3.82428,""outcomes,"":7.04316,""basic"":3.43224,""played"":5.94455,""senior"":4.4041}","{""shifts"":7.04316,""in"":2.23914,""organizational"":4.84594,""canada:"":6.35001,""and"":1.61381,""the"":1.75489,""demand"":7.04316,""passport"":6.35001,""transformation"":4.64526,""face"":6.35001,""of"":2.02588,""policy"":3.15134}"

2016 Manion Lecture - Values and Ethics: The Mark of Effective Leadership,"The 2016 Manion Lecture, held in May at the Canadian Museum of History, explored values and ethics as the mark of effective leadership. In this recording, Dick Pound, an international leader whose commitment to ethics and integrity are recognized worldwide, shares how his experiences have shaped the leader he is today. He also discusses ways to manage the ethical challenges and complexities that all leaders must face.

Improving Communication and Citizen Engagement,"The importance of knowing how to communicate effectively in a digital world is of critical importance to government. It's not only about using digital methods to send key messages and information to the right audiences, but also about using these methods to create meaningful engagement.
